# Inverted Index-based Search System
The goal is to build an efficient ranked retrieval system for an English corpora and develop compact, and efficient-to-query inverted index structures, and evaluate their performance.

- Note: If you want a copy of the corpus used, mail me at my email-id

## Setup
- gcc 7 version requried 

# Running the code
- First run build.sh to compile the code and get the executables
```
bash build.sh
```
- To obtain the inverted indexing of the collection, run the command
```
bash invidx.sh [coll-path] [indexfile] {0|1} {0|1}
```
  - `coll-path`: specifies the directory containing the files containing documents of the collection.
  - `indexfile`: is the name of the index files that will be generated by the program.
  - `{0|1}`: specifies the compressions that will be applied – 0 specifies no compression, and 1 specifies variable byte compression
  - `{0|1}`: specifies the name of the tokenizer used by the program – 0 specifies the simple tokenizer and 1 specifies the BPE tokenizer.
  
  The program generates two binary files:
  - `indexfile.dict`: contains the dictionary
  - `indexfile.idx`: contains the inverted index postings

- To perform TF-IDF retrieval using the index just built, run the command
```
bash tf_idf_search.sh [queryfile] [resultfile] [indexfile] [dictfile]
```
  - `queryfile`: a file containing queries
  - `resultfile`: the output file named resultfile which is generated by the program
  - `indexfile`: the index file generated by invidx cons program above which should be used for evaluating the queries
  - `dictfile`: the dictionary file generated by the invidx cons program above which should be used for evaluating the queries

  Result output format followed is the [trec-eval](https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval) format.
